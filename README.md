## Introduction

PHP Desktop is an open source project founded by [Czarek Tomczak](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xmoT5Z_zTHkVclqPzrs2aAV64Uiu7fh/view)
in 2012 to provide a way for developing native desktop GUI applications
using web technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript and SQLite. PHP Desktop
is basically what [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is, but with PHP support
added. You create client interface in JS/HTML5 and use PHP for back-end stuff
such as interacting with OS, filesystem and processing of data. So it works
similarly to your web application, but can run and act like a native desktop
application. The development workflow you are used to while creating web
applications remains the same. There is no new API/framework to learn. The
process of turning an existing website into a desktop application is basically
a matter of copying it to the "phpdesktop/www/" directory.

PHP Desktop is not meant as a professional environment for developing desktop
applications like the ones you can see developed in C++ programming language.
PHP Desktop is more of a GUI tool for converting your PHP web apps and PHP CLI
tools to desktop applications with little effort. If you have a big PHP code base
and want to reuse it on desktop then it makes sense to use PHP Desktop. If you
are more efficient in PHP programming than in JS programming then it
makes sense to use PHP Desktop instead of Electron. If you have PHP CLI tools
that you would like to convert to GUI tools then it makes sense to use PHP Desktop
than to rewrite everything in some other language or specific framework APIs.
With PHP Desktop you can accomplish great things in no time and painlessly.
But be aware that desktop integration APIs in PHP Desktop can be limited. This project
is not supported by big companies like Electron is and thus its development resources
are limited. Before creating a desktop application I suggest that you go through
documentation and see if the desktop integration API you need is available in PHP Desktop.
PHP Desktop doesn't provide many of the built-in desktop integration functionality that
you can find in Electron, but you can still accomplish many of these tasks by
integrating external tools/libraries with PHP Desktop.

In a certain sense phpdesktop acts as a PHP to EXE compiler. It embeds a web browser,
a multi-threaded web server and a PHP interpreter, all embedded into a single application,
a single folder, a portable zip that you can easily distribute to end users (or optionally
make it an installer). The web server embedded is a custom edition of
[Mongoose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose_(web_server)) (the MIT-licensed version),
a web server used by NASA on International Space Station.
Supported browsers are Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.
The package with Chrome embedded has no external dependencies, everything is included in
the phpdesktop binaries and works out of the box on a user's computer. PHP Desktop actually
embeds Chromium browser (using [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef)
to be specific) which is open source software on which Google Chrome is based, but for
the sake of simplicity we just call it Chrome or Google Chrome here.

All popular PHP frameworks are supported, see the [PHP frameworks support](../../wiki/PHP-frameworks-support)
wiki page for example configurations for CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Symfony, Yii
and Zend Framework.  You can create a standalone executable for distribution with the
help of the [Inno Setup installer](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).
PHP sources can be protected with the many of the available
[PHP encoders](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#how-do-i-protect-php-sources-in-the-www-directory).
PHP Desktop is released under non-restrictive license, thus it is 
[free for commercial use](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#can-i-use-php-desktop-in-a-commercial-closed-sourced-project).

It is one of the top goals for PHP Desktop to be stable, to work reliably. PHP Desktop does
not suffer from memory leaks. PHP by design was never intended for running long hours/days,
as desktop applications usually do. This is not a concern when using PHP Desktop, as it is
running an internal web server and serving pages through CGI. So when PHP script ends 
execution PHP-CGI process is killed and all memory is always freed.

Lots of other useful information can be found on the [Knowledge Base](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base)
wiki page and on the [PHP Desktop Forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phpdesktop).


## Sponsors

The PHP Desktop project is seeking companies to help make the project greater than it is today.
There is a lot that can be done for the project such as monthly releases with latest Chromium
version, an automated build system, cross-platform support with full functionality on Mac and Linux,
more Javascript and PHP API exposed for accomplishing desktop specific tasks, better integration
with desktop / taskbar / systray, HTTPS/SSL support, custom window themes, running app in background,
sqlite encryption, desktop notifications, and the many more proposals for new features submitted
in the issue tracker. If your company would like to sponsor PHP Desktop development efforts then please
contact [Czarek](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xmoT5Z_zTHkVclqPzrs2aAV64Uiu7fh/view). Long term
sponsorships are welcome and Czarek is open to ideas about the project. He would love to spend more
time on developing this project, but he can't afford doing so in his free time.


## Fundings for new features

Here is a list of ongoing fundings for the new features in PHP Desktop Chrome:

Feature | Funds gathered | Issue
--- | --- | ---
Chrome v70 release for Windows | $0 of $2,000 | [Issue #227](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/issues/227)
Initial Mac release | $150 of $2,000 | [Issue #208](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/issues/208)
Initial Linux release | $1,500 of $1,500 | [Issue #221](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/issues/221)

Please don't ask on the forums or in the issue tracker for how to update PHP Desktop
for Windows or how to make it work on Mac. Making a release and then supporting that
release requires a lot of work. If you want to support the project then please post a
bounty, even $5 is good. There are thousands of PHP Desktop users, if everyone would
post $5 then it would be more than enough to fund all the features.

Fundings for other features submitted in the issue tracker or the ones presented on the
[PHP Desktop Pro](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/wiki/PHP-Desktop-Pro)
wiki page are also possible, just let know Czarek.
